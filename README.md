# RecipeFinder
Search Recipe Folder.

The are a number of aims of this project.  
* Get some familiarity of GUI programming in C++, hence using Qt.  
* Implement a search-as-you-type functionality.   
* Use fuzzy searching to avoid having to have the exact name of the recipe I'm looking for.  

The fuzzy search is implemented using ```lib_fts``` from [forrestthewoods](https://github.com/forrestthewoods/lib_fts) on Github.

### To-do list
1. Need to handle the event where more than one result has the same rank.  
2. Application icon and launcher for Ubuntu.
