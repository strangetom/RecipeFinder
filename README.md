# RecipeFinder
Search Recipe Folder.

The are a number of aims of this project.  
* Get some familiarity of GUI programming in C++, hence using Qt.  
* Implement a search-as-you-type functionality.   
* Use fuzzy searching to avoid having to have the exact name of the recipe I'm looking for.  

The fuzzy search is implemented using ```lib_fts``` from [forrestthewoods](https://github.com/forrestthewoods/lib_fts) on Github.

### Installation
1. Download the latest version from the [releases](https://github.com/strangetom/RecipeFinder/releases) page
2. Mark as executable ```chmod +x RecipeFinder```
3. Run

Note that the program requires Qt 5.7 to run.
